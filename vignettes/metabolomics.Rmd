This time we will look at a small metabolomics dataset by @eucedaEvaluationMetabolomicChanges2017 and replicate the findings of @madssenRepeatedMeasuresASCA2020a. Note that this is an example of ALASCA applied on **intervention data**. If you are more interested in repeated measures **observational data**, have a look at [the preeclampsia vignette](pregnancy.html). If you want an introduction to ALASCA, have a look at [Get Started](ALASCA.html).

Let us start by having a quick look at it:

<div class="fold s">
```{r}
do.call(
  ggarrange,
  c(plotParts(df, participantColumn = "ID", valueColumn = "value", addSmooth = NA), 
                      common.legend = TRUE, legend = "bottom")
  )
```
</div>

So there is three time points, two groups and 16 variables. @madssenRepeatedMeasuresASCA2020a state that <blockquote>All metabolite responses were log-transformed before analysis, and the effect matrix was mean-centered before PCA.</blockquote> But our data is already log-transformed, and centering is handled by `ALASCA()`. However, as instructed by the authors, we need to scale each metabolite with the standard deviation at baseline. So let us set the desired reference groups and normalize:

<div class="fold s">
```{r}
df$group <- relevel(df$group, ref = "Chemotherapy only")
df$time <- relevel(df$time, ref = "TP1")

scaleFun <- function(df){
  for(i in unique(df$variable)){
    df$value[df$variable == i] <- df$value[df$variable == i]/sd(df$value[df$variable == i & df$time == "TP1"])
  }
  return(df)
}

```
</div>

Without any fuss, let us see what ALASCA makes out of it using the same model as @madssenRepeatedMeasuresASCA2020a. Note that we have to `forceEqualBaseline` to remove the interaction term for TP1 * treatment.

```{r}
form <- value ~ time + time:group + (1|ID)
mod <- ALASCA(df, form, separateTimeAndGroup = FALSE, forceEqualBaseline = TRUE, scaleFun = scaleFun)
```

Let us check that our model is as expected:

```{r}
summary(mod$regr.model[[1]])
```

And now, let us plot it:

```{r}
screeplot(mod)
```

And compare to the original plot:

![](Madssen_1.jpg)

```{r}
plot(flipIt(mod))
```

Note that we used the \code{\link{flipIt()}} function to flip the loadings and scores to produce similar plots as in the original article.

```{r}
plot(mod, component = 2)
```

As we can see, it looks indeed as a very good match with the original findings.

Let us validate our model (outside knitr, it uses about 2 seconds per run),

```{r, message=FALSE}
mod$nValRuns = 10
mod.val <- validate(mod, participantColumn = "ID", validateRegression = FALSE)
mod.val <- flipIt(mod.val, component = 1)
```

The result:

```{r}
plot(mod.val)
plot(mod.val, component = 2)
```

Or if want to see the validation models instead of error bars:

```{r}
plotVal(mod.val)
plotVal(mod.val, component = 2)
```

### Using Rfast

However, there is a way to increase speed: `method = "Rfast"` will employ the `Rfast` package, which is usually much faster (in this case, we get about an order of magnitude better):

```{r, message=FALSE}
mod.Rfast <- ALASCA(df, form, 
                    separateTimeAndGroup = FALSE, 
                    forceEqualBaseline = TRUE, 
                    scaleFun = scaleFun,
                    validate = TRUE,
                    nValRuns = 50,
                    method = "Rfast")
mod.Rfast <- flipIt(mod.Rfast)
```

## More interaction term

Sometimes we need mote advanced models than the one demonstrated above. For example, the dataset contains both responders and responders, and these groups may be different at baseline. Thus, we cannot simply make four groups and rerun the model above. We can add more terms to the formula, and specify that we want to keep them in the effect matrix by listing them in a vector given to `keepTerms`,

```{r, message=FALSE}
form <- value ~ time + response + time:group:response + (1|ID)
mod.interaction <- ALASCA(df, form, 
      separateTimeAndGroup = FALSE, 
      forceEqualBaseline = TRUE, 
      scaleFun = scaleFun, 
      method = "Rfast", 
      validate = FALSE, 
      keepTerms = c("response"))
plot(mod.interaction)
```

The responders start out with lower levels of glucose, but have a steeper increase - interesting!

## Separating time and group effects

It may sometimes be illustrative to extract the general time development in the model. To do this, we use `separateTimeAndGroup = TRUE`

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
There is a bug here, and this should not be used!
</div>

```{r, message=FALSE}
form <- value ~ time + response + time:group:response + (1|ID)
df$response <- factor(df$response)
df$response <- relevel(df$response, ref = "Responder")
df$group <- factor(df$group)
df$group <- relevel(df$group, ref = "Bevacizumab treated")
mod.interaction <- ALASCA(df, form, 
     separateTimeAndGroup = TRUE, 
     forceEqualBaseline = TRUE, 
     scaleFun = scaleFun, 
     validate = FALSE, 
     keepTerms = c("response"))
plot(mod.interaction)
```

## Comparison of result

To better visualize the agreement between the ALASCA package and the published code by @madssenRepeatedMeasuresASCA2020a, I've run both and collected the loadings and scores for P1 and PC2. Although there are some variation in the robustness estimates, the two implementations seem to match reasonable well.

<div class="fold s">
```{r, echo = FALSE}
df <- read.csv(file = "Madssen_Jarmund_loadings.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";", fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM")
df <- rbind(df,
            data.frame(
              getLoadings(mod.val)$time,
              model = "Jarmund"
            ))
df <- rbind(df,
            data.frame(
              getLoadings(mod.Rfast)$time,
              model = "Jarmund Rfast"
            ))

g1 <- ggplot(subset(df, PC == 1), aes(x = covars, y = loading, ymin = low, ymax = high, color = model)) + geom_pointrange(position = position_dodge(width = 0.35)) + theme_bw()
g2 <- ggplot(subset(df, PC == 2), aes(x = covars, y = loading, ymin = low, ymax = high, color = model)) + geom_pointrange(position = position_dodge(width = 0.35)) + theme_bw()

df <- read.csv(file = "Madssen_Jarmund_scores.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";", fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM")
df <- rbind(df,
            data.frame(
              getScores(mod.val)$time,
              model = "Jarmund"
            ))
df <- rbind(df,
            data.frame(
              getScores(mod.Rfast)$time,
              model = "Jarmund Rfast"
            ))

g3 <- ggplot(subset(df, PC == 1), aes(x = paste(time, group), y = score, ymin = low, ymax = high, color = model)) + geom_pointrange(position = position_dodge(width = 0.35)) + theme_bw()
g4 <- ggplot(subset(df, PC == 2), aes(x = paste(time, group), y = score, ymin = low, ymax = high, color = model)) + geom_pointrange(position = position_dodge(width = 0.35)) + theme_bw()

ggarrange(g3, g1, g4, g2, 
          nrow = 2, ncol = 2,
          common.legend = TRUE)
```
</div>

## Permutation testing

We have implemented a simple permutation test for getting P values.

<div class="fold s">
```{r}
mod.perm <- ALASCA(df, form, separateTimeAndGroup = FALSE, forceEqualBaseline = TRUE, 
                   scaleFun = scaleFun, method = "Rfast", validate = TRUE, 
                   validationMethod = "permutation", nValRuns = 1000)
mod.perm$pvals
```
</div>

## Regression models

Sometimes it may be difficult to interpret the ALASCA plots and you may wish to visualize the underlying regression models. The ALASCA package features a function for that: `plotPred()`:

<div class="fold s">
```{r}
do.call(
  ggpubr::ggarrange,
  c(plotPred(mod, variable = c("Glucose", "Glutathione")), 
                      common.legend = TRUE, legend = "bottom")
  )
```
</div>
